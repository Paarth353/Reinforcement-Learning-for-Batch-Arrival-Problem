- Slotted System, Single Queue with Binomial i.i.d batch arrivals
- We have a choice to serve K packets at a cost of 0 or M packets with a cost of C 
- Reward = Queue Length at the beginning of episode + Cost of serving
- The queue is capped at a Max queue length 
- The task is to find the optimal policy such that the long run expected discounted reward is maximum
